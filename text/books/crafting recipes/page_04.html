# Bullet casing Mold
	"---",
	"-S-",
	"-C-",
	S = Steel Sheet
	C = wirecutters
	Maybe there are other recipes with a similar configuration?

# Bullet casings
	Melt some brass down with the casing mold for 30

# Brass
	2 copper ingots, 1 zinc ingot. Makes 3

# Bullet to gunpowder
	Taking a bullet in the second middle slot of a bullet press with wirecutters next to it should safely extract a pouch of gunpowder.

# Bullets?
	" P ",
	" GM",
	" C ",
	P = Pellets
	G = Gunpowder
	C = Casings
	M = magazine to fill

	It looks like combining some pellets made by wirecutting a rod with some gunpowder and spare shells, I can make my own ammo!
	It seems not every combination is possible, but i've discovered that magnesium makes incen ammo, and plasteel makes premium ammo!
	Ill need as many casings as ammo the magazine can hold, and I should know I wont be able to fill non-standard ammo types at a premium restocker.
	So it seems paying for depleted uranium slugs is off the charts. If you need to make a single round, like for shotguns, just replace the empty Mag with one
	of the base ammo. No need for new gunpowder or casings! If I fail crafting, and I know it works, I should make sure the mag is EMPTY...
