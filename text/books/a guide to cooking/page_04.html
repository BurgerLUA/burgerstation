Making Cake

Combine 15 parts flour, 5 parts sugar, 5 parts egg whites, 5 parts egg yolk to get 30 parts of cake batter. From there, you can **bake it** giving you time to make the **icing**.

When it comes to **icing**, there are two types, one by **combining** 1 part corn flour 1 part sugar for 1 icing sugar, and the other by **combining** 1 part icing sugar and 1 part water for 1 part white icing.

If you **bake** cake dough, it will turn into a very nice cake!
