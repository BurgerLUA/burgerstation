## Making Bread
Combine 3 parts flour with 2 parts water to get 5 parts of pure dough. From there, you can either **cut it**, **bake** or **flatten** it.

When it comes to **cutting**>, you can cut pieces as much as you want as long as total parts **equals 10u**.

If you bake dough, it will turn into white bread which you can **cut** into burger buns.

If you bake dough with **30u or more** parts dough, it will turn into a loaf of bread.

If you bake flat dough, it will turn into flat dough which you can **cut** into flat bread. Note: the amount of parts doesn't seem to matter here.
