# Technique

Ghosts almost always prefer extremely dark spaces to haunt as it gives them the most protection from would-be ghost hunters. Not only does it restrict visibility, but the darkness slowly depletes a hunter's sanity over time. Don't ask us how it works, it just does. Staying in the light helps stave off sanity. You should keep lights on or bring a light with you to prevent sanity loss. Note that excessive light in a ghost's location will upset the ghost, so be sure to only turn on lights in areas where the ghost is not hiding.

Ghosts also prefer silence. Making noises tends to upset the ghost and target the one who is the noisiest. Sometimes this isn't always the case and will target anyone nearby.
