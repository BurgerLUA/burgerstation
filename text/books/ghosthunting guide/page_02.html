# Equipment

There are 4+2 things you need.
- An EMF Counter
- A chime.
- A plastic flashlight.
- A ghost box.
- A light sensor (Optional)
- Wooden Crucifix (Optional) 


## EMF Counter
An absolute essential to hunting ghosts. An EMF counter informs you if a ghost is nearby or has recently interacted with the environment. It detects up to 5 levels of EMF, each with increasing intensity. It periodicity plays a sound when levels exceed 3.
- EMF Level 1: There are no ghosts nearby. This is passive EMF radiation.
- EMF Level 2: There is passive ghost activity nearby, but it isn't strong or hostile enough to interact with the physical plane.
- EMF Level 3: There is probable ghost activity nearby. This means that a ghost used its power to interact with the world around them.
- EMF Level 4: There is confirmed ghost activity nearby. This means that a ghost has used an excessive amount of power to interact with the world around hi.
- EMF Level 5: There is extremely powerful ghost activity nearby. For your own safety, you should vacate the area immediately as these levels will very likely result in death.

## Chime
A chime is an annoying plastic device that beeps when it receives a signal. By default, a motion sensor is attached to it. The motion sensor is strong enough to detect lifeforms, living or dead, manifesting in the world. 
Chimes should be used sparingly as the noise may anger the spirit prematurely.

## Plastic Flashlight
One might think that a tactical flashlight would be recommended, however the issue is that they're extremely strong and may either frighten the ghost or anger it too quickly. A plastic flashlight is perfect when it comes to navigating the area safely.

## Ghost Box
A ghost box is used for trapping ghosts, allegedly. To be perfectly honest, we don't even know if it works yet. Inform us if it does! Our scientists say that it traps ghosts who pass over it, but only if they're fully manifested in the world.

## Light Sensor
Detects and quantifies the current areas natural and man-made light in the area. Not something you realy need, but it's good if you want to be scientific about monitoring the light levels in the area.

## Wooden Crucifix
Prevents ghosts from hunting you, as long as the crucifix is on the ground. Do we know if this works? Don't know. We usually prefer science over religion.
