## How To Actually Fish
Once ready, you cast your rod into the water.
Give it a moment and once you hear a little *ding* **pull it back**!
If you hear a second ding you're done, you're fucked, you cant fish fuck you.

However if you didn't then you caught something! Yipee! Congrats! Good! Great! Hope that wasn't too hard for your peanutbrain! teehee

Depending on your bait, you can catch multiple times of things, from fish to good ol' sea booty.
You can even fish fishing supplies. Really. Yeah. It's uh something.

Anyway, if you've caught a cool fish you can just straight up eat it *or* you can just **stab** it a little to prepare it for cooking.
