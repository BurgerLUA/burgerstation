## Finally Back to the Secret Fishing Spot
### The week has finally ended, at last the boys can finally get together and have some **fun**.
You must be a cultured individual for getting this book. That's a no brainer.
The art of fishing is very simple, it is a way of life shared from generation to generation.
## The Basics
First you need a rod, duh, then the essentials.

A line, which may or may not **break** depending on how well you're doing unless you're a rich motherfucker then shake that wallet.
A good ol' little bobber, any is fine but dont go for cheap stuff, it'll decide how much **time** it will take and how **fast** you have to be.
Can't forget the bait, get the right **type** for the right **water**, otherwise you're just gonna get still-cool-but-less-cool-than-usual fish (all fish are cool). Oh, also they are *usually* one-time use, keep that in mind.

Now all you gotta do is put them all **together** and you'll be good to go. Remember to attach some **bait** before you cast, what's gotta catch if you dont have BAIT!!!!!!! dumbass
That's been part 1 of this master plan, on to part 2.
