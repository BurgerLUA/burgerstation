Cyborgs are nearly completely synthetic beings, save for their brain, that discarded their human husk in trade for a steel one. Cyborgs have their own unique shared blood type, immunity from poison, radiation, holy magic, dark magic, pain, and fatigue, minor resistance to blades, piercing weapons, and the cold. Note that their drawbacks include susceptibility to ion, heat, and magic, and they cannot effectively cast holy or dark magic.
