Need to know your defences? An armor analyzer can be purchased from Research that can calculate the defences of a certain bodypart on a living creature. Works on enemies, too!
Weapon attachments can be found or purchased in the armoury to affect weapon damage and accuracy.
Some bullets that do not match the gun's caliber can be inserted into it anyways if they're a close enough size.
Some bullets have additional variants that do added effects when used against an enemy.
Deployable barricades can be purchased from engineering. They are quite robust.
Deployable sentries can be purchased from the advanced security vendor. They are fragile, hoever can help out a lot when properly defended.
