/*
Future reference for everyone who'd be willing to do crafting recipes -
Grid goes like this:
a1,a2,a3
b1,b2,b3
c1,c2,c3
i.e. minecraft-like stick recipe would be like this:
a1,a2,a3
b1,plank,b3
c1,plank,c3
And the code would look like this:
"a1" = null,
"a2" = null,
"a3" = null,
"b1" = null,
"b2" = plank,
"b3" = null,
"c1" = null,
"c2" = plank,
"c3" = null
