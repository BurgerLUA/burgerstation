# Contributing to Burgerstation.
## Follow these simple rules, and you can have your PR SPEEDMERGED on this project. More rules will be added when needed.

## Rule 0: Give appropriate credit.
If you're porting something or adding assets to the server from amother server, always give appropriate credit in your PR.

## Rule 1: No Map Edits.
Do not edit the map files unless you first get Burger's permission first. The map is changed constantly and will very likely conflict.

## Rule 2: No balance changes (without permission).
Given the nature of the game and how balance changes constantly with new features, I don't want to cause stress to contributors where their balance change is now irrelevant because a new item was added to the. Ask if you wish to to a crack an balancing something. Make sure you add a good explination as to why you balanced it that way.
